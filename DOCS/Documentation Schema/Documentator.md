  Constructor  
  Method: `__init__`

  [Provide a  highly detailed description of what the constructor does. Explain what it initializes, what components it connects to, and any important setup steps. Include information about the initial state and any dependencies.]

  - **Parameters:**
    - `[parameter_name]` ([parameter_type], [optional/required]): [Provide a detailed description of the parameter, including its purpose, default value if optional, and any constraints.]
    - ...
  - **Returns:** [Describe the return value if applicable, otherwise state "None."]

### Methods

## Method: `[method_name]`

  [Provide a highly detailed description of the method. Explain its functionality, the components it interacts with, and the typical scenarios in which it is called.
