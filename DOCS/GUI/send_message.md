## Function: send_message

Handles the initial sending of a message from the user.

- **Parameters:**
  - `chat_component` (ChatComponent, required): The chat component instance.
  - `user` (str, required): The user sending the message.
  - `message` (str, required): The message to be sent.
  - `session_id` (str, required): The current session ID.
  - `conversation_id` (str, required): The current conversation ID.
  - `conversation_manager` (ConversationManager, required): Manages conversation history and state.
  - `model_manager` (ModelManager, required): Manages the models used for generating responses.
  - `provider_manager` (ProviderManager, required): Manages the providers used for generating responses.

- **Returns:** None

**Detailed Description:**

The `send_message` function is responsible for initiating the process of sending a message. It logs the action, displays the user's message in the chat component, and then calls the `process_message` function to handle further processing.

**Example usage:**


await send_message(chat_component, user, "Hello!", session_id, conversation_id, conversation_manager, model_manager, provider_manager)

## Function: process_message

Handles the processing of a message, including generating a response from the system.

- **Parameters:**
  - `chat_component` (ChatComponent, required): The chat component instance.
  - `user` (str, required): The user sending the message.
  - `message` (str, required): The message to be processed.
  - `session_id` (str, required): The current session ID.
  - `conversation_id` (str, required): The current conversation ID.
  - `conversation_manager` (ConversationManager, required): Manages conversation history and state.
  - `model_manager` (ModelManager, required): Manages the models used for generating responses.
  - `provider_manager` (ProviderManager, required): Manages the providers used for generating responses.

- **Returns:** None

**Detailed Description:**

The `process_message` function handles the core logic of processing a user's message. It attempts to generate a response using the provider manager's `generate_response` method. If successful, it displays the response in the chat component; otherwise, it logs an error and shows an error message.

**Example usage:**


await process_message(chat_component, user, "How are you?", session_id, conversation_id, conversation_manager, model_manager, provider_manager)
