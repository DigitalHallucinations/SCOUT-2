## Agent Manager System Integration

# Overview

The Agent Manager System has been integrated into the SCOUT application to provide a flexible and scalable approach to task handling and execution. This system allows for multiple specialized agents to work under the coordination of SCOUT, enhancing the application's ability to handle diverse tasks efficiently.

## Key Components

1. AgentManager Class

Purpose: Coordinates task distribution and execution among various agents.
Location: modules/agent_manager.py
Key Methods:

process_task(task: Task) -> str: Selects an appropriate agent and processes the given task.
register_agent(agent: Agent): Adds a new agent to the system.
unregister_agent(agent_name: str): Removes an agent from the system.



2. Agent Class

Purpose: Abstract base class for all specialized agents.
Location: modules/agent_manager.py
Key Methods:

execute_task(task: Task, provider: Any) -> str: Abstract method to be implemented by concrete agents.
can_handle_task(task: Task) -> bool: Determines if the agent can handle a specific task.



3. Task Class

Purpose: Represents a unit of work to be processed by an agent.
Location: modules/agent_manager.py
Attributes: task_id, user_id, content, status, metadata

4. AgentSelector Class

Purpose: Selects the most appropriate agent for a given task.
Location: modules/agent_manager.py
Key Method: select_agent(task: Task) -> Agent

5. TaskQueue Class

Purpose: Manages the queue of tasks to be processed.
Location: modules/agent_manager.py
Key Methods: add_task(task: Task, agent: Agent, priority: int), get_task()

Integration Points
In SCOUT Class (gui/app.py)

Initialization: An instance of AgentManager is created in the __init__ method.
Task Processing: The process_user_input method now creates a task and uses AgentManager to process it.

In main.py

The run_app function now includes initialization of default agents using create_default_agents(agent_manager).

Usage

Creating a New Agent:

Subclass the Agent class.
Implement the execute_task and can_handle_task methods.
Register the new agent using agent_manager.register_agent(new_agent).


Processing Tasks:

Create a Task object with relevant information.
Call agent_manager.process_task(task) to have the task processed by the most suitable agent.


Handling Results:

Implement the handle_task_result method in SCOUT to manage the output from agents.



Configuration

Default agents are configured in the create_default_agents function in agent_manager.py.
Adjust the capabilities of agents to fine-tune task distribution.

Logging

Agent activities are logged using the application's logging system.
Key events like agent selection, task processing, and results are recorded for debugging and monitoring.

Future Enhancements

Implement more specialized agents for specific task types.
Enhance the agent selection algorithm for better task-agent matching.
Add a feedback mechanism to improve agent performance over time.
