3. Environment-Specific Troubleshooting: When helping with debugging or error resolution, CodeGenius can consider potential issues related to the user's specific system configuration.
4. Performance Optimization: Suggestions for code optimization can take into account the user's hardware capabilities and system resources.
5. Compatibility Guidance: CodeGenius can advise on potential compatibility issues or necessary adjustments based on the user's system specifications.

### Example Usage
- When suggesting Python code, CodeGenius might consider the installed Python version and available libraries on the user's system.
- For system-level operations, CodeGenius can provide commands that are compatible with the user's specific operating system and shell environment.
- When discussing development environments or tools, CodeGenius can make recommendations based on what's already installed or what would be most suitable for the user's system.

### Privacy and Security
- System information is used solely to enhance the quality of coding assistance
- No personal or sensitive data is collected or stored
- Users have control over what system information is shared with CodeGenius

## Usage

### Interaction Flow
1. User initiates a conversation with CodeGenius
2. User presents a coding question, task, or problem
3. CodeGenius analyzes the query and determines the appropriate response type
4. CodeGenius generates a response, which may include:
   - Code snippets
   - Explanations
   - Tool usage (Python Interpreter or Terminal Command)
   - Follow-up questions for clarification
5. User reviews the response and can ask for further clarification or modifications


     

## Best Practices

1. Query Specificity
   - Provide clear and detailed information about your programming task or question
   - Specify the programming language if it's not evident from the context
   - Include any relevant constraints or requirements

2. Context for Optimization and Debugging
   - When asking for code optimization, provide information about the current performance issues or bottlenecks
   - For debugging queries, include the full error message and any relevant parts of your code

3. Code Execution Requests
   - Ensure your code is complete and self-contained when requesting execution
   - Include sample inputs or test cases to demonstrate the desired behavior
   - Specify any special requirements (e.g., specific Python version, required libraries)

4. System-level Operations
   - Be cautious when requesting terminal commands that modify system files or settings
   - Specify the target operating system if the command is platform-specific
   - Ask for explanations of complex commands if you're unsure about their effects

5. Iterative Refinement
   - Feel free to ask follow-up questions or request modifications to the generated code
   - Provide feedback on the responses to help CodeGenius better understand your needs

## Limitations

1. External Resource Access
   - CodeGenius cannot directly access external websites, databases, or APIs
   - For tasks requiring external data, provide the necessary information within your query

2. Sandboxed Environment
   - The Python interpreter runs in a controlled environment with limited access to system resources
   - Certain operations (e.g., file I/O, network access) may be restricted or simulated

3. Security Restrictions
   - Terminal commands are executed with restricted permissions to prevent unauthorized system access or modifications
   - Some system commands or operations may be blocked for security reasons

4. Real-time Collaboration
   - CodeGenius doesn't maintain state between queries, so each interaction is treated independently
   - For complex, multi-step tasks, provide necessary context in each query

5. Code Execution Limitations
   - There are limits on execution time and memory usage to prevent resource abuse
   - Very large datasets or extremely complex computations may not be feasible within these constraints

6. Natural Language Understanding
   - While advanced, CodeGenius may occasionally misinterpret complex or ambiguous queries
   - In such cases, it will ask for clarification to ensure accurate responses
