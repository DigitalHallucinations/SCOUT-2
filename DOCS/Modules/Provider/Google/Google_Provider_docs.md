## Module: GG_gen_response.py

The `GG_gen_response.py` module is responsible for generating responses using Google's GenAI API based on user inputs, conversation history, and specific persona configurations. It manages the entire flow of generating a response, including handling user messages, formatting the conversation history, creating request bodies, and processing the API response. Additionally, it integrates with text-to-speech services to provide audio feedback when appropriate.

## Function: create_request_body

Creates the request body for the GenAI API call, including conversation history, persona settings, and generation configurations.

- **Parameters:**
  - `current_persona` (dict, required): Contains the persona configuration.
  - `messages` (list, required): The conversation history formatted as a list of messages.
  - `temperature_var` (float, required): Controls the randomness of the generated response.
  - `top_p_var` (float, required): Controls the diversity of the generated response.
  - `top_k_var` (int, required): Limits the number of possible next tokens.
  - `functions` (list, optional): List of functions to include in the request.
  - `safety_settings` (dict, optional): Settings for safety controls in the generation process.

- **Returns:** 
  - `data` (dict): The formatted data for the API request.

**Example usage:**


data = create_request_body(current_persona, messages, 0.7, 0.9, 40)

## Function: generate_response

Asynchronously generates a response using the GenAI API, processes the response, and manages the conversation history.

- **Parameters:**
  - `user` (str, required): The user ID.
  - `current_persona` (dict, required): Contains the persona configuration.
  - `message` (str, required): The latest message from the user.
  - `session_id` (str, required): The session ID for the conversation.
  - `conversation_id` (str, required): The conversation ID.
  - `temperature_var` (float, required): Controls the randomness of the generated response.
  - `top_p_var` (float, required): Controls the diversity of the generated response.
  - `top_k_var` (int, required): Limits the number of possible next tokens.
  - `conversation_manager` (ConversationManager, required): Manages the conversation history.
  - `model_manager` (object, required): Manages the model configuration.
  - `provider_manager` (object, optional): Manages external service providers.

- **Returns:** 
  - `ChatResponse` (str): The generated chat response.

**Example usage:**


response = await generate_response(user, current_persona, message, session_id, conversation_id, 0.7, 0.9, 40, conversation_manager, model_manager)

## Function: contains_code

Checks if the provided text contains any code snippets.

- **Parameters:**
  - `text` (str, required): The text to be checked.

- **Returns:** 
  - `bool`: True if the text contains code, otherwise False.

**Example usage:**


if contains_code(ChatResponse):
    print("The response contains code.")

## Function: format_message_history

Formats the message history to reduce token count and improve readability for the model.

- **Parameters:**
  - `messages` (list, required): The list of message dictionaries.
  - `user_name` (str, required): The name of the user.
  - `assistant_name` (str, required): The name of the assistant.
