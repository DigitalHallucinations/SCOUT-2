# TaskManager Development Plan

## Immediate Tasks (Next 2 Weeks)

1. Refine Current Integration
   - Review and optimize the current integration of TaskManager with ChatComponent
   - Ensure there are no conflicts with the existing message handling flow
   - Add comprehensive logging throughout the TaskManager for better debugging

2. Enhance TaskPlanner
   - Implement basic keyword recognition to identify multiple tasks in a single user request
   - Create a simple task prioritization system based on predefined keywords

3. Improve TaskQueue
   - Implement a more robust priority queue system
   - Add methods for rearranging tasks in the queue

4. Extend TaskExecutor
   - Implement basic error handling and task retry mechanism
   - Add capability to handle different types of tasks (e.g., information retrieval, computation, external API calls)

5. Update Documentation
   - Create inline documentation for all TaskManager methods
   - Update the main TaskManager documentation with new features and usage instructions

## Short-Term Goals (1-2 Months)

1. Develop Basic NLP Capabilities
   - Integrate a simple NLP library (e.g., spaCy or NLTK) into the TaskPlanner
   - Implement intent recognition to better categorize user requests into task types

2. Create Task Types
   - Define a set of task types (e.g., Query, Action, Calculation)
   - Implement type-specific execution methods in TaskExecutor

3. Implement Parallel Task Execution
   - Modify TaskExecutor to run independent tasks concurrently
   - Ensure thread-safety in TaskQueue and result handling

4. Develop a Simple Task Visualization
   - Create a basic UI component to display the current task queue
   - Implement real-time updates as tasks are added, executed, or completed

5. Integrate with Persona System
   - Modify TaskExecutor to select appropriate personas for different task types
   - Implement a simple capability matching system between tasks and personas

## Medium-Term Objectives (2-4 Months)

1. Advanced NLP and Task Planning
   - Implement context-aware task planning
   - Develop capability to understand and plan multi-step tasks

2. Sophisticated Task Prioritization
   - Implement dynamic prioritization based on task type, user preferences, and system load
   - Develop a fairness mechanism to prevent low-priority tasks from being indefinitely delayed

3. Long-running and Background Tasks
   - Implement a system for managing tasks that may take extended time to complete
   - Develop a mechanism for running tasks in the background and notifying users upon completion

4. Task Dependencies
   - Implement a system for defining and managing dependencies between tasks
   - Develop a scheduler that can optimize task execution based on dependencies

5. User Interaction with Task System
   - Develop UI components for users to view, modify, and cancel tasks
   - Implement a system for users to define custom task sequences or macros

6. Performance Optimization
   - Conduct thorough performance testing of the TaskManager system
   - Optimize for reducing latency and improving throughput

7. External API for Task Management
   - Design and implement an API for external systems to interact with the TaskManager
   - Develop authentication and rate-limiting mechanisms for the API

## Implementation Strategy

1. Adopt an iterative development approach, implementing and testing features incrementally
2. Regularly update the main application to integrate new TaskManager features
3. Maintain comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
4. Keep documentation up-to-date with each new feature or significant change
5. Conduct code reviews for all major changes to ensure quality and maintainability
6. Regularly seek user feedback on new features and prioritize accordingly

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Ensuring TaskManager doesn't introduce latency
   **Mitigation**: Implement performance benchmarks early and optimize continuously

2. **Challenge**: Maintaining conversation fluidity with task-based approach
   **Mitigation**: Carefully design user experience to make task management transparent to the user

3. **Challenge**: Complexity of implementing advanced NLP
   **Mitigation**: Start with simple NLP techniques and gradually increase complexity; consider using pre-trained models

4. **Challenge**: Balancing system resources with parallel task execution
   **Mitigation**: Implement resource monitoring and dynamic adjustment of concurrency levels

By following this plan, we can systematically enhance the TaskManager's capabilities while ensuring it integrates smoothly with the existing SCOUT application. Regular reviews and adjustments to this plan will be necessary as development progresses and new insights are gained.
