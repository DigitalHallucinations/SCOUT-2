# TaskManager Documentation

## Overview

The TaskManager is a component of the SCOUT application designed to manage the planning, queuing, and execution of tasks derived from user inputs. It aims to enhance the application's ability to handle complex, multi-step interactions and improve resource management.

## Components

1. **TaskPlanner**: Responsible for breaking down user requests into individual tasks.
   - Current implementation: Returns the user request as a single task.
   - Future enhancement: Implement NLP to intelligently parse and subdivide complex requests.

2. **TaskQueue**: Manages the list of tasks to be executed.
   - Implements priority-based queuing.
   - Allows for adding, retrieving, and potentially reordering tasks.

3. **TaskExecutor**: Handles the execution of individual tasks.
   - Currently uses the existing `send_message` function to process tasks.
   - Future enhancement: Implement more sophisticated task execution strategies.

4. **TaskManager**: Orchestrates the overall task management process.
   - Coordinates between TaskPlanner, TaskQueue, and TaskExecutor.
   - Provides the main interface for the ChatComponent to interact with the task management system.

## Current Integration

The TaskManager is currently integrated into the SCOUT application as follows:

1. Instantiated in the `SCOUT` class (`app.py`).
2. Passed to the `ChatComponent` during initialization.
3. Used in the `process_user_input` method of `ChatComponent` to handle user messages.

## Usage

To use the TaskManager:

1. Ensure it's properly instantiated and passed to the ChatComponent.
2. In the ChatComponent, use the `process_user_input` method of TaskManager instead of directly calling `send_message`.
3. The TaskManager will handle the planning, queuing, and execution of tasks.

## Roadmap

1. Short-term goals:
   - Implement basic NLP in TaskPlanner to identify and separate multiple tasks in a single user request.
   - Add task prioritization based on keywords or user preferences.
   - Implement basic error handling and task retry mechanisms.

2. Medium-term goals:
   - Develop a more sophisticated TaskPlanner that can understand context and create more granular task breakdowns.
   - Implement parallel task execution for independent tasks.
   - Create a user interface for viewing and managing the task queue.

3. Long-term goals:
   - Implement machine learning models to improve task planning and prioritization based on user behavior and feedback.
   - Develop a system for long-running or background tasks.
   - Create an API for external systems to add tasks to the queue.
   - Implement a task dependency system for complex, multi-step operations.

## Potential Challenges and Considerations

1. Balancing granularity: Breaking tasks down too much could lead to overhead, while not enough could limit flexibility.
2. Maintaining conversation flow: Ensure that breaking requests into tasks doesn't disrupt the natural flow of conversation.
3. Performance: As complexity increases, ensure that the TaskManager doesn't introduce significant latency.
4. Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of task types and increasing complexity of requests.
