# TerminalCommand.py

## File Location
modules/Tools/Base_Tools/TerminalCommand.py

## Overview
This module provides functionality to execute terminal commands asynchronously with various control options.

## Key Components

### Functions:
1. `async def TerminalCommand(command: str, timeout: int = 60, encoding: str = 'utf-8', verbose: bool = False, output_limit: int = 1024 * 1024, max_retries: int = 3, wait_for_indefinite_app: int = 10)`
   - Executes a terminal command asynchronously
   - Parameters:
     - `command`: The command to execute
     - `timeout`: Maximum execution time (default: 60 seconds)
     - `encoding`: Output encoding (default: 'utf-8')
     - `verbose`: Enable verbose logging (default: False)
     - `output_limit`: Maximum output size in bytes (default: 1MB)
     - `max_retries`: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
     - `wait_for_indefinite_app`: Wait time for apps expected to run indefinitely (default: 10 seconds)
   - Returns: A dictionary containing the command output, error (if any), and status code

## Dependencies
- asyncio
- time
- ctypes
- sys

## Key Functionalities
1. Asynchronous command execution
2. Timeout handling and retry mechanism
3. Logging of command execution and results
4. Special handling for indefinitely running applications
5. Command history tracking

## Usage
This function can be called to execute terminal commands asynchronously with various control options.

## How the Agent Uses This File
The agent uses this file when it needs to interact with the system's terminal or command line. Common use cases include:
- Executing system commands or scripts
- Retrieving system information
- Manipulating files or directories
- Running external programs or tools
- Performing system maintenance tasks

The agent can call the `TerminalCommand()` function with specific commands and options, allowing it to interact with the system in a controlled and safe manner. The function's ability to handle timeouts, retries, and indefinitely running applications makes it versatile for various system interaction needs.
