## Overview
This module provides functionality to perform Google searches using the SerpAPI service.

## Key Components

### Classes:
1. `GoogleSearch`
   - Main class for performing Google searches
   
   #### Methods:
   - `__init__(self, api_key=SERPAPI_KEY)`
     - Initializes the GoogleSearch instance with an API key
   
   - `async def _search(self, query: str) -> Tuple[int, Union[dict, str]]`
     - Performs an asynchronous HTTP request to the SerpAPI service
     - Parameters:
       - `query`: The search term
     - Returns: A tuple containing the status code and either the JSON response or an error message

## Dependencies
- os
- requests
- typing (Tuple, Union)
- modules.Providers.OpenAI.openai_api (OpenAIAPI)
- modules.logging.logger (setup_logger)

## Key Functionalities
1. Asynchronous Google search using SerpAPI
2. Error handling for HTTP errors and general exceptions
3. Logging of search operations and results

## Usage
This class can be instantiated and used to perform Google searches asynchronously, returning the search results or error information.

## How the Agent Uses This File
The agent uses this file when it needs to perform web searches to gather information. Some common scenarios include:
- Answering user queries that require up-to-date information
- Fact-checking or verifying information
- Gathering data for research or analysis tasks
- Finding relevant web pages or resources for a given topic
- Staying informed about current events or trending topics

The agent can create an instance of the `GoogleSearch` class and use its `_search()` method to perform searches based on user queries or its own information needs. The search results can then be processed and incorporated into the agent's responses or used for further analysis and decision-making.
