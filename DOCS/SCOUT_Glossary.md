# SCOUT Glossary

## A

### AI Provider
A service or platform that offers artificial intelligence capabilities, such as natural language processing or machine learning models. SCOUT supports multiple AI providers for flexible integration.

Examples include OpenAI, Google AI, and Anthropic. Each provider may offer different models, pricing structures, and specific features.

*See also: [ProviderManager Module](#providermanager-module), [AI Model](#ai-model)*

### AI Model
A specific machine learning model provided by an AI provider. Models can vary in size, capabilities, and specialization.

Examples:
- GPT-4 (OpenAI)
- BERT (Google)
- Claude (Anthropic)

Different models may be better suited for different tasks within SCOUT.

*See also: [ModelManager Module](#model-manager-module)*

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. In SCOUT, APIs are used to interact with various components and external services.

SCOUT uses both internal APIs (for communication between modules) and external APIs (for interacting with AI providers and other services).

*See also: [ProviderManager Module](#providermanager-module), [ToolIntegration Module](#toolintegration-module)*

### Artifact
In SCOUT, an artifact refers to a piece of content (such as code, documents, or images) generated or manipulated during a conversation. Artifacts can be saved, edited, and referenced throughout the application.

Artifacts are typically larger, self-contained pieces of content that users might want to modify or use outside of the conversation context.

*See also: [ChatComponent Module](#chatcomponent-module)*

### Asynchronous Programming
A programming paradigm that allows operations to run independently of the main program flow. SCOUT uses asynchronous programming to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.

In SCOUT, asynchronous programming is crucial for maintaining a responsive user interface while performing potentially time-consuming operations like API calls or file I/O.

*See also: [send_request Method](#method-send_request), [DataStorage Module](#datastorage-module)*

## C

### Chat Component
The core module of SCOUT that handles the chat interface, message processing, and interaction with AI providers. It's responsible for displaying messages, sending user inputs to the AI, and presenting AI responses.

Key features:
- Message history management
- Integration with AI providers
- Support for rich media in messages (text, images, code blocks)

*See also: [ChatComponent Module](#chatcomponent-module)*

### Configuration Manager
A module responsible for managing application-wide and user-specific settings in SCOUT. It handles reading from and writing to configuration files, and provides an interface for other modules to access and modify settings.

Managed settings may include:
- UI preferences (theme, font size)
- AI provider preferences
- Tool integration settings

*See also: [ConfigurationManager Module](#configurationmanager-module)*

### Conversation
A series of messages exchanged between the user and the AI within SCOUT. Conversations can be saved, loaded, and analyzed.

Features:
- Persistence across sessions
- Ability to switch between multiple conversations
- Support for conversation summarization and search

*See also: [save_conversation Method](#method-save_conversation), [ConversationManager Module](#conversationmanager-module)*

### Cognitive Services
A set of AI-powered tools and APIs that enable SCOUT to process and understand complex information. These may include:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Speech Recognition and Synthesis

Cognitive services enhance SCOUT's ability to interact with users and process various types of data.

*See also: [CognitiveServices Module](#cognitiveservices-module)*

## D

### Data Storage
The system used by SCOUT to persist and retrieve various types of data, including user information, chat history, and application settings.

Features:
- Support for multiple storage backends (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Efficient querying and indexing

*See also: [DataStorage Module](#datastorage-module)*

## E

### Event
A signal emitted by SCOUT components to indicate that a specific action or state change has occurred. Other parts of the application can listen for and respond to these events.

Common events in SCOUT:
- message_sent
- response_received
- persona_changed
- error_occurred

Events enable loose coupling between components and facilitate reactive programming patterns.

*See also: [Events in ChatComponent](#events)*

## F

### Function Call
In SCOUT, a function call refers to the AI's ability to request the execution of a specific function or tool within the application. This allows the AI to perform actions or retrieve information beyond its training data.

Example function calls:
- Retrieving current weather information
- Scheduling a calendar event
- Performing a calculation

*See also: [ToolIntegration Module](#toolintegration-module)*

## P

### Persona
A predefined set of characteristics, knowledge, and behavior patterns that can be applied to the AI to give it a specific "personality" or area of expertise.

Personas in SCOUT might include:
- CodeGenius: Specialized in programming and software development
- MathWizard: Expert in mathematics and problem-solving
- CreativeWriter: Focused on creative writing and storytelling

Personas help tailor the AI's responses to specific user needs or preferences.

*See also: [PersonaManager Module](#personamanager-module)*

### Provider
See [AI Provider](#ai-provider).
