## Accessing CodeGenius UI

1. Open the SCOUT application.
2. Look for the tool control bar, usually located at the top of the interface.
3. Click on the "CodeGenius" button to open the CodeGenius UI.

## Interface Overview

The CodeGenius UI consists of three main areas:

1. **Code Input Area**: A text editor where you can write your Python code.
2. **Output Display**: Shows the results of your executed code and any visualizations.
3. **Toolbar**: Located below the code input area, includes Run and Stop buttons for managing code execution.

## Writing and Executing Code

1. Click on the code input area.
2. Type or paste your Python code.
3. Click the "Run" button on the toolbar to execute your code.

Example:

print("Hello, CodeGenius!")


### Stopping Code Execution

1. If you need to stop the execution of your code, click the "Stop" button on the toolbar.

## Viewing Results

After executing your code:

1. The output will appear in the output display area.
2. Text output will be shown as plain text.
3. Errors, if any, will be displayed in red.

## Visualizations

CodeGenius UI attempts to visualize numeric output:

1. Lists of numbers may be displayed as bar charts.
2. Other data types will be displayed as formatted text.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Keep your code snippets focused and concise for best performance.
- Use print statements to debug your code.
- Experiment with different data structures to see how they're visualized.

## Troubleshooting

- If your code doesn't execute, check for syntax errors.
- Ensure you're not importing modules that aren't available in the CodeGenius environment.
- If the UI doesn't update, try closing and reopening the CodeGenius UI.
