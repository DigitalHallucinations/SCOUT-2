## Overview

This script initializes and runs the SCOUT application, managing logging, exception handling, and dynamically loading modules based on the selected Large Language Model (LLM) and background providers. It also ensures proper shutdown and cleanup of tasks and resources.

## Imports

The script imports various modules and functions for:

- Logging and debugging.
- Asynchronous programming.
- Managing the GUI application.
- Dynamically importing modules.
- Handling threading and memory tracing.

## Setup Logging

Logging is configured with a custom logger to ensure that all log messages are properly formatted and directed to the appropriate output. Memory tracing is started to help with debugging memory usage issues.

## Custom Exception Hook

A custom exception hook is defined to log any uncaught exceptions. This is essential for debugging, as it provides detailed error information in the logs, making it easier to identify and fix issues that cause the application to crash.

## Global Variables

Several global variables are defined to manage the application's state, tasks, and dynamically loaded modules. These variables include flags to indicate whether the application should exit, sets to keep track of global tasks, and lists to store dynamically loaded modules.

## Context Managers

An asynchronous context manager is defined to handle background tasks. This context manager ensures that background tasks are properly managed and cleaned up when no longer needed, helping to maintain the application's stability and performance.

## Main Application Loop

The `run_app` function handles the main application loop. It dynamically loads modules based on the selected LLM and background providers. Depending on the provider chosen, the corresponding module is imported and used. This function also ensures that all tasks are gathered and awaited, ensuring smooth operation of the application.

## Shutdown Procedure

The `shutdown` function handles the cleanup and shutdown tasks. It ensures that all resources and connections are properly closed, such as closing the SCOUT application, terminating any remaining tasks, and closing database connections. This prevents resource leaks and ensures the application can be restarted cleanly.

## Main Function

The `main` function initializes and starts the SCOUT application. It sets up the main application loop and waits for a shutdown event. This function ensures that the application runs within an asynchronous event loop, coordinating the startup, operation, and shutdown phases of the application.

## Entry Point

The script's entry point ensures that the `main` function is executed within an asyncio event loop when the script is run directly. This is the standard way to start an asyncio-based application, ensuring that all asynchronous tasks are properly managed and executed.
