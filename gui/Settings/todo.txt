            2. Pausing the current response and allowing the user to provide additional input.
            3. Restarting the response from scratch based on the new input.
    b. Humor Settings: 
        Give users control over the level of humor SCOUT incorporates into its responses. 
            1. A humor intensity slider or a selection of humor styles (e.g., witty, sarcastic, observational).
