 As a CodeGenius, there are several tools that can be built to enhance my capabilities and make me more effective. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Code Snippet Generator**: This tool can generate code snippets based on the user's requirements. It can take a description of the functionality needed and generate the corresponding code.

2. **Code Review Tool**: This tool can analyze the user's code and provide suggestions for improvements, such as identifying potential bugs, performance issues, or violations of coding standards.

3. **Automated Testing Tool**: This tool can generate test cases based on the user's code. It can help ensure that the code is working as expected and catch any issues early in the development process.

4. **Documentation Generator**: This tool can generate documentation based on the user's code. It can help make the code easier to understand and maintain.

5. **Code Formatter**: This tool can automatically format the user's code according to a specified style guide. It can help make the code more readable and consistent.

6. **Dependency Analyzer**: This tool can analyze the dependencies in the user's code and provide a visual representation of them. It can help the user understand the structure of their code and identify potential issues.

7. **Performance Profiler**: This tool can analyze the performance of the user's code and identify any bottlenecks. It can help the user optimize their code for better performance.

8. **Code Completion Tool**: This tool can suggest code completions as the user is typing. It can help speed up the coding process and reduce the chance of typos.

Remember, the effectiveness of these tools will depend on the quality of the NLP module you've built, as well as the specific programming languages and frameworks you're targeting.
