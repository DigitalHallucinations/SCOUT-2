# Functions JSON

The `functions.json` file is a configuration file that defines the available functions and their parameters for the RSS Feed Reader module. It serves as a bridge between the AI model and the RSS Feed Reader application, allowing the AI model to control and interact with the application by invoking specific functions.

## Structure

The `functions.json` file follows a specific structure to define the available functions and their parameters. Here's an example of the structure:

```json
{
    "name": "rss_feed_reader",
    "description": "Reads and parses RSS feeds, allowing you to add, remove, and retrieve feed entries.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "action": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["add_feed", "remove_feed", "get_feeds", "update_feed", "get_feed_entries", "get_entry_details", "remove_entry"],
                "description": "The action to perform on the RSS feed."
            },
            "feed_url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL of the RSS feed."
            },
            "category": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The category of the RSS feed (optional)."
            },
            "enabled": {
                "type": "boolean",
                "description": "The enabled status of the RSS feed (optional)."
            },
            "entry": {
                "type": "object",
                "description": "The entry object (required for 'get_entry_details' action)."
            },
            "entry_title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the entry to remove (required for 'remove_entry' action)."
            }
        },
        "required": ["action"]
    }
}
```

The `functions.json` file contains the following key-value pairs:

- `name`: The name of the module or functionality being described (e.g., "rss_feed_reader").
- `description`: A brief description of what the module or functionality does.
- `parameters`: An object that defines the parameters accepted by the functions.
  - `type`: Specifies the type of the parameters object (usually "object").
  - `properties`: An object that defines the individual parameters and their properties.
    - `action`: Specifies the available actions that can be performed on the RSS feed.
    - `feed_url`: Specifies the URL of the RSS feed.
    - `category`: Specifies the category of the RSS feed (optional).
    - `enabled`: Specifies the enabled status of the RSS feed (optional).
    - `entry`: Specifies the entry object (required for the 'get_entry_details' action).
    - `entry_title`: Specifies the title of the entry to remove (required for the 'remove_entry' action).
  - `required`: An array that specifies the required parameters for the functions.

## Usage

The AI model can use the `functions.json` file to understand the available functions and their parameters in the RSS Feed Reader module. It can then invoke these functions by sending appropriate commands or requests to the application.

Here's an example of how the AI model can use the `functions.json` file to control the RSS Feed Reader application:

1. The AI model reads the `functions.json` file to understand the available functions and their parameters.

2. To add a new RSS feed, the AI model sends a command with the following parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "action": "add_feed",
       "feed_url": "https://www.example.com/feed",
       "category": "News"
   }
   ```

3. To remove an RSS feed, the AI model sends a command with the following parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "action": "remove_feed",
       "feed_url": "https://www.example.com/feed"
   }
   ```

4. To retrieve the list of added feeds, the AI model sends a command with the following parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "action": "get_feeds"
   }
   ```

5. To retrieve the entries for a specific feed, the AI model sends a command with the following parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "action": "get_feed_entries",
       "feed_url": "https://www.example.com/feed"
   }
   ```

6. To retrieve the details of a specific entry, the AI model sends a command with the following parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "action": "get_entry_details",
       "entry": {
           "title": "Example Entry",
           "link": "https://www.example.com/entry",
           "published": "2023-06-08",
           "summary": "This is an example entry."
       }
   }
   ```

7. To remove a specific entry from a feed, the AI model sends a command with the following parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "action": "remove_entry",
       "feed_url": "https://www.example.com/feed",
       "entry_title": "Example Entry"
   }
   ```

The RSS Feed Reader application receives these commands from the AI model and executes the corresponding functions based on the provided parameters. The application then returns the appropriate response or data back to the AI model.

## Customization

The `functions.json` file can be customized to include additional functions or modify the existing ones based on the specific requirements of the RSS Feed Reader application. When adding new functions or modifying existing ones, make sure to update the `functions.json` file accordingly and ensure that the AI model is aware of the changes.

## Considerations

- The AI model should have access to the `functions.json` file to understand the available functions and their parameters.
- The AI model should send commands or requests to the RSS Feed Reader application in the format specified by the `functions.json` file.
- The RSS Feed Reader application should be designed to handle the commands or requests received from the AI model based on the `functions.json` file.
- Proper error handling and validation should be implemented in both the AI model and the RSS Feed Reader application to handle invalid or missing parameters.

By utilizing the `functions.json` file, the AI model can effectively control and interact with the RSS Feed Reader application, enabling seamless integration and automation of RSS feed management and retrieval tasks.
