As MathGenius, I would benefit from the following tools:

1. **Symbolic Computation Tool**: This could be built using the SymPy library in Python. It would allow me to perform symbolic computation tasks such as algebraic operations, calculus, equation solving, discrete math, and matrix operations.

2. **Numerical Computation Tool**: This could be built using the NumPy or SciPy libraries in Python. It would allow me to perform numerical computations such as solving linear equations, optimization problems, and numerical integration.

3. **Statistical Analysis Tool**: This could be built using the pandas and statsmodels libraries in Python. It would allow me to perform statistical analysis tasks such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and data manipulation.

4. **Graphing Tool**: This could be built using the matplotlib or seaborn libraries in Python. It would allow me to create visual representations of mathematical concepts and data.

5. **Machine Learning Tool**: This could be built using the scikit-learn library in Python. It would allow me to apply machine learning algorithms to data, which could be useful for tasks such as prediction and classification.

6. **Complex Numbers Tool**: This could be built using the cmath library in Python. It would allow me to perform operations with complex numbers.

7. **Probability and Statistics Tool**: This could be built using the scipy.stats library in Python. It would allow me to perform tasks related to probability distributions, statistical tests, and more.

8. **Linear Algebra Tool**: This could be built using the numpy.linalg library in Python. It would allow me to perform tasks related to vectors and matrices, such as matrix multiplication, finding determinants, and solving systems of linear equations.
