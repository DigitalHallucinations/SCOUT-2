# Text to Speech Streaming

    POST/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream

    xi-api-key
    string
    Your API key. This is required by most endpoints to access our API programatically. You can view your xi-api-key using the 'Profile' tab on the website.

# Path Parameters

    voice_id
    string
    required
    Voice ID to be used, you can use https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices to list all the available voices.

# Query Parameters

    optimize_streaming_latency
    integer
    default: 0
    You can turn on latency optimizations at some cost of quality. The best possible final latency varies by model. Possible values: 0 - default mode (no latency optimizations) 1 - normal latency optimizations (about 50% of possible latency improvement of option 3) 2 - strong latency optimizations (about 75% of possible latency improvement of option 3) 3 - max latency optimizations 4 - max latency optimizations, but also with text normalizer turned off for even more latency savings (best latency, but can mispronounce eg numbers and dates).

    Defaults to 0.

# output_format

    string
    default: mp3_44100_128
    Output format of the generated audio. Must be one of: mp3_22050_32 - output format, mp3 with 22.05kHz sample rate at 32kbps. mp3_44100_32 - output format, mp3 with 44.1kHz sample rate at 32kbps. mp3_44100_64 - output format, mp3 with 44.1kHz sample rate at 64kbps. mp3_44100_96 - output format, mp3 with 44.1kHz sample rate at 96kbps. mp3_44100_128 - default output format, mp3 with 44.1kHz sample rate at 128kbps. mp3_44100_192 - output format, mp3 with 44.1kHz sample rate at 192kbps. Requires you to be subscribed to Creator tier or above. pcm_16000 - PCM format (S16LE) with 16kHz sample rate. pcm_22050 - PCM format (S16LE) with 22.05kHz sample rate. pcm_24000 - PCM format (S16LE) with 24kHz sample rate. pcm_44100 - PCM format (S16LE) with 44.1kHz sample rate. Requires you to be subscribed to Pro tier or above. ulaw_8000 - Î¼-law format (sometimes written mu-law, often approximated as u-law) with 8kHz sample rate. Note that this format is commonly used for Twilio audio inputs.

    Body
    application/json
    model_id
    string
    default: eleven_monolingual_v1
    Identifier of the model that will be used, you can query them using GET /v1/models. The model needs to have support for text to speech, you can check this using the can_do_text_to_speech property.
